# Employee-Database_SQL

## Background
Conduct a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

Design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, perform the following:

1. Data Modeling
2. Data Engineering
3. Data Analysis


### Bonus
Generate a visualization of the data by:

1. Importing the SQL database into Pandas.
2. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.
3. Include a technical report in markdown format, in which the data engineering steps are outlined.
